# IntersectionZoo

[IntersectionZoo](https://intersectionzoo-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a cooperative eco-driving-based multi-agent reinforcement learning environment for benchmarking contextual reinforcement learning algorithms to assess their generalization capabilities. Additionally, it also aims to advance eco-driving research through standardized environments and benchmarking. 

See our [documentation](https://intersectionzoo-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information on the application of IntersectionZoo. A comprehensive report of [benchmarking results](https://intersectionzoo-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarking.html) is available in the documentation.
